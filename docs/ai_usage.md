What I asked for: Translate a given RNA string into the corresponding protein string using the standard RNA codon table.
What I changed before committing: Wrote a Python function to read codons in triplets and stop translation at "Stop" codons.
How I verified correctness: Tested on sample dataset and confirmed output matched MAMAPRTEINSTRING.
